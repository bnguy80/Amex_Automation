- Excel data manipulation, and transaction processing—three distinct responsibilities—it is likely that the facade class is handling too much.
  Each of these responsibilities should ideally be handled by its own class.
  This is a concept known as the Single Responsibility Principle, a core tenet of SOLID principles in object-oriented design.
class PDFProcessor:
    pass  # PDF processing functionality goes here


class ExcelDataHandler:
    pass  # Excel data manipulation functionality goes here


class TransactionProcessor:
    pass  # Transaction processing functionality goes here


class WorkflowFacade:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pdf_processor = PDFProcessor()
        self.xlsx_handler = ExcelDataHandler()
        self.tx_processor = TransactionProcessor()

    def process_workflow(self, pdf_file, xlsx_file, transactions):
        pdf_data = self.pdf_processor.process(pdf_file)
        xlsx_data = self.xlsx_handler.handle(xlsx_file)
        processed_txs = self.tx_processor.process(transactions)

        # etc
